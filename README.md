# Cookie32 – Expressive Robot 🤖

## Introduction

**Cookie32** is an expressive robot project focused on displaying emotions through facial elements (eyes, mouth, lighting effects) and simple movements. The project is designed for learning, research, and experimentation in embedded systems, signal processing, and human–robot interaction (HRI).

Cookie32 follows a **modular and extensible design**, allowing developers to easily modify hardware or algorithms to add new expressions and behaviors.

## Key Features

* Facial expression rendering (happy, sad, surprised, angry, etc.)
* Real-time control using a microcontroller
* Modular architecture for easy expansion
* Suitable for experimenting with basic AI or behavior logic 🧠

## System Requirements

### Hardware

* Microcontroller: ESP32 (recommended)
* Display module (OLED / LCD / LED Matrix)
* Servo motors or DC motors (for movement, optional)
* Stable power supply (battery or adapter)

### Software

* Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
* ESP32 board support package
* Display control libraries (SSD1306, TFT, etc.)
